### Hi! I'm owozsh!

- Some of you may know me as the developer behind the Myopia Theme for the Gnome Desktop Environment;
- I'm a Software Developer and UX Designer;
- Currently I'm developing TTM, a Tiling Task Manager;
- Fun fact: Although I was a Theme maker, nowadays I 'fight' against themes, as they can mess with the original software;
- How to reach me: owozsh@pm.me
